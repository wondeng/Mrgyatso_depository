**Wonden's Terminal Portfolio**

A terminal-inspired personal website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Originally forked from [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm) and personalized to showcase my projects, resume, and contact info — all through a command-line interface.
